Projects
Here are some notable projects I have worked on:

🚀AI-Driven Sentiment Analyzer: Created an AI-driven Sentiment Analyzer leveraging SVM model to analyze consumer sentiments towards a brand, specifically focusing on Amazon reviews. Deployed as a dynamic web application with live text analysis and real-time scraping of Reddit posts, providing comprehensive sentiment insights through visualizations of SVM model data and sentiment analysis of each post.
🚀Airline Feedback Site: Developed a user-friendly web application using Python-Flask, HTML, and CSS to collect valuable feedback from customers for various airlines. Employed MongoDB as the robust database solution, ensuring efficient data management and seamless integration for enhanced user experience.
🚀Agriculture Management System: Developed a user-friendly Agriculture Management System using HTML and CSS for the front-end, and PHP and MySQL for the back-end. This robust system efficiently manages and tracks various aspects of agriculture, including crop information, inventory management, and resource allocation. By leveraging my skills in web development, I successfully created an intuitive platform that streamlines agricultural processes, enhancing productivity and decision-making for farmers and agricultural organizations.
